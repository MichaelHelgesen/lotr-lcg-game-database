# Lord Of The Rings Living Card Game database

I´m trying to create a custom version of [Sanitys](https://www.sanity.io) headless CMS to keep track of different aspects regarding the card game [Lord Of The Rings The Living Card Game](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game/) by [Fantasy Flight](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/index/).
